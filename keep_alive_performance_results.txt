# Created by Javier Cabero on 05/14/2019.
#
# This test results were generated using the `ab` command
# found in keep_alive_performance.sh. They demonstrate the
# superior performance of the keep-alive requests against
# the ones without it.
# 
# The first part is the trace without keep-alive and after the
# dash-line, the one with keep-alive. Check the 'Connection Times'
# table for the timing of the requests.
#Â 
# Executed on a Macbook Pro with macOS Mojave, 2,9 GHz Intel Core i7
# and 16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3 of RAM.

# Without keep-alive.
